This will be a complete rewrite of Trunk Player, all from scratch! The new version will be all API based, Kubernetes Ready, and Feature a beautiful new REACT UI thanks to @nebraskaCoder!

Dont expect this soon, Likely wont be till Summer, or Fall. But progress Continues, and we will work to keep updating the community! We are on a mission to build the most functional, feature rich, and obviously coolest looking Trunk playback UI

## Development Update 1/1/21
---

### Today I am confident to say to day the API (Only the API, not all functionality) has gone from PreAlpha to Alpha 

- I have connected TrunkPlayer-NG to Trunk Recorder and all seems to be working well!
- Automatic System Radio Reference Import
- Tested New Python feed script (working on site-offline caching (On TR Host))
- I have tested audio file storage locally, and just need to test S3 (Will be natively secured)
- I have Tested System Forwarders (Sending a Systems TX's to separate TP-NG)
- I have Tested native Multi-Site Feed (With Allow/Block Lists)

Next steps:
---
- Setup Tasks for radio operations 
- Setup Sockets.io Web communications
- Setup Metrics App and API
- Make official TR Plugin! 

Just wanted to share the updates, as I was able to get quite a bit done over the holiday... and well the last Dev update was frankly underwhelming :( . We are getting closer! **I'm optimistic that we can see a beta version by spring (Just API Backend for now)**!

As for the frontend, dev is just starting as now the API's are Functional and @nebraskacoder can start to use them. So expect more and more frontend news in the near-distant future!

### STAY TUNED!!!
